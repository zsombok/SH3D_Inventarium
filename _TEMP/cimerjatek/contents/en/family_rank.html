      <p>The R&aacute;k&oacute;czi family used to be a gentry family of local significance for a long time. Zsigmond
        R&aacute;k&oacute;czi, the ancestor of Ferenc II R&aacute;k&oacute;czi, received the rank of baron in 1588.
        Originally, aristocracy wasn't divided into different classes in Hungary, the various ranks (barons, counts and
        princes) became common during the reign of the House of Habsburg.</p>

      <p>Over time, also a closed princely coronet was added to their coat of arms, as this family branch gave
        Transylvania five princes.</p>
