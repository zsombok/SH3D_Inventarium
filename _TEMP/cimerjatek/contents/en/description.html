      <p>The description and meaning of the coat of arms can be found in a work dedicated to and supported by
        Gy&ouml;rgy I R&aacute;k&oacute;czi, set in contemporary wording:</p>
    </h1>
    <div class="content-text">
      <p>It is all due that the R&Aacute;K&Oacute;CZI clan received a respectable coat of arms<br />From his Majesty,
        the King, for valiant speed and advice he gave in war,<br />In this, a bold eagle spreads its wings, holding a
        sword in its right,<br />And so, there is its left foot too, on a wheel and holding tight,<br />It bears a crown
        and, in the centre, there, a crowned helmet shines;<br />which is a sign of the great faith of this respectable
        clan.<br />For the eagle's spread-out wings, swiftness and valour do proudly signify,<br />with the naked sabre,
        held in the talon of the bird, all this coincides,<br />And in the end, the turns of luck, peace do also
        bring,<br />The King's grace, his great promise, is shown by all these things.<br /><br /></p>
