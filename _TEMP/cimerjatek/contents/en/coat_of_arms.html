    <div class="content-text">
      <p>Coats of arms used to be donated by the ruler, who rewarded exceptional deeds by donating a rank and a coat of
        arms symbolizing these deeds. <br />With the donation, not only the man of merit, but often his close family
        members, and, of course, his descendants were given a rank among the gentry or the noble. The coat of arms was
        also a symbol of family cohesion, passed down from generation to generation, sometimes in slightly different
        versions. Over time, the ancient coat of arms could also be amended, for example, upon achieving a higher rank.
        <br />In the lower part of the escutcheon of the ancient coat of arms of the R&aacute;k&oacute;czi family, there
        is a bird turned to the left, standing on a cartwheel broken - truncated - at the bottom. Unfortunately, the
        original meaning of the symbols of the coat of arms is unknown. The broken cartwheel might have represented the
        right of the sword or even turns of luck. The bird might have been a raven or an eagle.</p>
